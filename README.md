# COVID-Vaccine-Appointments---India
A quick and easy way to get available vaccine appointments (18 - 44) in your state, district and dates of interest.


Finding appointments for COVID vaccines is far from easy on the CoWIN portal.
The endless wait for the OTP, the limited slots for 18-44 age group, and the need to choose districts one-by-one make it
difficult to find slots.

I have tried to solve these problems by making a quick and easy Python Code that you can run on your machine to find
vaccination slots for you and your family/friends. You can also change the 'min_age_limit' filter in the appointments
function to show appointments for 45+ age group as well.

Let me know if you want me to add other features or make something better.

Stay Safe, Get Vaccinated, Protect Yourself and Your Loved Ones.
We will beat SARS-COV-2.
